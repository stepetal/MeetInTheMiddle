# MeetInTheMiddle
Implementation of MITM attack with C++ on double des using DES from openssl library.
The source of idea and inspiration: https://github.com/npapernot/double-des-meet-in-the-middle.git
Can be 18 or more bits. Time of attack depends on location of the interval of brute force(belongs to only one key or
shared between two keys).
